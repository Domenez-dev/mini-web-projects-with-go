# GoLang Mini Web Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of mini web projects written in GoLang. Each project is designed to explore and demonstrate various web development concepts and libraries in Go. The projects are organized into separate folders, each containing a fully functional application with its own README file for detailed instructions.

## Projects

### Existing Projects

- **Secure Login:** Demonstrates user authentication mechanisms including login, registration, CSRF protection, and session management using cookies.
- **Todo App:** A basic Todo application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

### Future Perspectives

This repository is a continuous learning journey and will be expanded to include more mini web projects utilizing different Go web libraries. The aim is to gain practical experience and understanding of various Go web frameworks and libraries, such as:

- **Chi:** A lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services.
- **Gin:** A web framework written in Go (Golang) that features a martini-like API with much better performance.
- **Fiber:** An Express-inspired web framework written in Go with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.
- **Gorilla Toolkit:** A collection of packages that provide various functionalities for building robust web applications in Go.

### Learning Objectives

- **Understanding GoLang Web Development:** Each project is an opportunity to delve deeper into GoLang web development, exploring different patterns, practices, and libraries.
- **Exploring Web Frameworks:** By working with frameworks like Chi, Gin, Fiber, and the Gorilla Toolkit, I am learning their unique features, strengths, and use cases.
- **Building Robust Applications:** These projects help in understanding how to build secure, maintainable, and efficient web applications.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Others can benefit from this repository by seeing practical implementations of GoLang web projects. It's a valuable resource for learning different aspects of web development in GoLang.
